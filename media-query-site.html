    <h1>Media Queries</h1>
    <div class="column">
      <p>Media queries allow us to make our sites <em>responsive</em>. We can use media queries to apply CSS styling only when certain conditions apply. For instance, our sites can look different depending on the size of the screen, or <em>viewport</em> a user is viewing our content with. We can also change the way our site appears if a user is printing our website, or using a screen-reader! </p>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <p>Using media queries and responsive design allows us to ensure that our site looks and works great no matter <em>how</em> the user is viewing it.</p> And, as more and more people use more and more devices to browse the internet, integrating media queries into websites is becoming a common, widespread practice!
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <p>Are you beginning to see the possibilities here? Media queries are awesome!</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Media Types</h2>
    <p>Media queries often specify something called a media type.
      As the name implies, a media type refers to the type of media-viewing
      device the user is viewing our site with. We have the following
      options to choose from:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          all: Refers to any and all devices.
        </li>
        <li>
          print: Refers to viewing our site in "print preview" mode.
        </li>
        <li>
          screen: Refers to color screens.
        </li>
        <li>
          screen: Refers to color screens.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Additionally, note that if you do not explicitly specify a
        type, your media query will default to all.We can add the media
         type to our query like this: </p>
      <pre>
        @media screen () {

        }
      </pre>
     <h2>Media Features</h2>
     <p>Next, our media query requires we include something called a
       media feature. Media features are specific properties and
       details about the manner the user is viewing content.
       The most commonly-used media features are:</p>
       <ul>
         <li>
           height: Describes the height of the viewport, in pixels.
         </li>
         <li>
           width: Describes the width of the viewport, in pixels.
         </li>
         <li>
           orientation: Indicates whether the viewport is landscape
           (wider than it is tall) or portrait (taller than it is
           wide).
         </li>
         <li>
           screen: Refers to color screens.
         </li>
       </ul>
       <p>Additionally, note that if you do not explicitly specify a
         type, your media query will default to all.We can add the media
          type to our query like this: </p>
   <pre>
     @media screen and (max-width: 768px) {

     }
   </pre>
   <p>A breakpoint is the point at which a media query's condition
     becomes true. For instance, because our media query has a
     max-width of 768px, it will apply its styles only when the
     viewport is 768px or less wide. 768px is therefore the
     breakpoint, because it is the point at which the query will be
     "activated".</p>
     <p>Let's add some basic, yet noticeable styles, so we can readily see when
       hey're being applied:</p>
       <pre>
         @media screen and (max-width: 768px) {
             body {
             background-color: black;
             color: white;
           }
         }        
       </pre>

  </body>
